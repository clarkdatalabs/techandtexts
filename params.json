Over the course of the Fall 2016 semester we will meet every other Thursday from 1:30pm-3:00pm to discuss, explore and experiment with various data visualization technologies and theoretical texts. _Text meetings (Sept 22, Oct 20, Nov 17 and Dec15) will be held in the Digital Projects Studio (3169 Shapiro) and Tech meetings (Oct 6, Nov 3 and Dec 1) will be held in the Clark Library Presentation Space (2 South Hatcher)._\r\n\r\nMeetings are open to anyone at any skill level. It is not necessary to attend all meetings; please join us as you have time and interest. The text discussions will include a brief introduction to the reading, so come even if you have not finished the reading. Tech explorations will be an open format for experimentation and shared learning.
