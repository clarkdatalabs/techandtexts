Tech and Texts is an open seminar/workshop hosted by the University of Michigan Library to explore the technology and theory behind data visualization. Over the course of the Fall 2016 semester we will meet every other Thursday from 1:30pm-3:00pm to discuss, explore and experiment with various data visualization technologies and theoretical texts. _Most Text meetings (Oct 20, Nov 17 and Dec15) will be held in the Digital Projects Studio (3169 Shapiro) and The first meeting and Tech meetings (Sept 29, Oct 6, Nov 3 and Dec 1) will be held in the Clark Library Presentation Space (2 South Hatcher)._

Meetings are open to anyone at any skill level. It is not necessary to attend all meetings; please join us as you have time and interest. The text discussions will include a brief introduction to the reading. Tech explorations will be an open format for experimentation and shared learning (please bring a laptop). If you have any questions about the series you can contact Justin Joque (joque@umich.edu) or Alix Keener (alixkee@umich.edu).

PDFs of all of the readings are available. Please register by filling out this **[this form](https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPshfPBCARrd1vWjPisaXS0agQNKPPQyOuYot2vLprOuO1wA/viewform)** and we will add you to the CTools site for access.
